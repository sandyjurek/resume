<p>Oakland County, MI government website - Back in 2000, the web was in its infancy. Oakland County was looking to establish itself as a leader in technology, and needed a new web hosting environment, web publishing content management system, and design. I lead the team that implemented the solution, and I created the first enterprise navigation system, standardized a common look and feel across all departments, and created new online services from manual processes. I even originated the trend of creating URLs using this naming convention.

<p>I lead the team to redesign and modernize the Macomb County, MI government website in 2014 and introduced a brand new streamlined navigation structure.</p>

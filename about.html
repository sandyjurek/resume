<h1>Bio of Sandy Jurek</h1>
    <h2>Leader, Doer, Strategist</h2>

    <p>I have been working in technology since the early 1990s when the Internet was just a budding medium. As an Editor at that time, I was tasked with figuring out how to deliver digital data over the Internet.
        From that first project where I was writing hyper-text markup language by hand, to now leading multi-billion dollar efforts -- my career has always been focused on delivering cutting-edge solutions that delight users.

    </p>

    <p>From the early days of digital publishing, I went on to build websites for some of Metro Detroit's most important institutions and companies. I've lead teams building enterprise solutions for online services, customer service, marketing and promotion, and many other uses. Concurrently, I bought a building in downtown Detroit and, together with my husband, opened and operated a black-box theater and cafe space for local artists.</p>

    <p>My government career started out as a planned 6-month engagement with Oakland County, MI -- that turned into 12 years. During that time, Oakland County became one of the most technologically advanced governments in the world as a result of the work me and my team did. The success of that effort lead to my being hired as Chief Information Officer at Macomb County, MI government -- where they had been in a state of disarray. I went in there and completely reorganized the staffing structure, working with five different unions that I had to negoiate changes with.</p>
